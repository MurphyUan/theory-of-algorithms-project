# theory-of-algorithms-project
The purpose of this repository, is to detail the Polynomial Time Complexity Class through the study of the Theory of Algorithms module in Year 4 of Software Development at ATU Galway.

This notebook labeled polynomial_time.ipynb will compare and contrast the Polynomial (P) and the Non-Deterministic Polynomial (NP) Time Complexity Classes, this inlcudes examples of problems belonging to both Complexity Classes and some solutions that have been found, however most if not all NP problems do not have solutions and are actively being studied to this day.
